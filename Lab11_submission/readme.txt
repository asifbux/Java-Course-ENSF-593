INTRODUCTION
------------

The purpose of this program is to build a binary search tree using the data from the input file provided by the user, the program will either perform insertion into and deletion from the tree. Additionally, the program can traverse the binary search tree recursively, printing out the nodes in ascending logical order; i.e. do a depth-first, in-order tree traversal and breadth-first traversal. The user will be able to request a output file of the binary search tree.

 STEPS TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM
