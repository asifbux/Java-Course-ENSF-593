INTRODUCTION
------------

The purpose of this program is to implement and compare sorting algorithms in Java. The first exercise of the program generates random integer values in arrays and outputs their time consumption as well as output file containing the sorted arrays. On the other hand, the second exercise uses a list of words from an input file which are then sorted and stored in LinkedList data structure type, which further contains their anagram if there are any. The program inserts the anagram words in the LinkedList in alphabetical order and further sorts them alphabetically using quick sort in the ArrayList that holds all the LinkedList Nodes. The program outputs a file containing the list of words and their anagrams.

 STEPS TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM
